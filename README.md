# SandboxPlus, an S&box Game

Play it on [sbox.game](https://sbox.game/wiremod/sandboxplus)!

Its built on top of [Sandbox Classic](https://github.com/Softsplit/sandbox) (which itself is a rewrite of Facepunch's Sandbox for the Scene system), with additions to make it more extendable (adding events, publicizing UI globals, etc), while staying unopinionated/light. The goal is "Gmod 2", replicating the functionality found in Gmod's Sandbox gamemode (with improvements).

## Improvements over Facepunch/sandbox:

### Gameplay

- It exists (since Facepunch deleted theirs)
- Variety of Tools:
- - Constraint tool: an omni-tool (like Precision Tool) with all your classic Gmod constraints (weld/axis/rope/elastic/slider/ballsocket) and nudge/rotate/move
- - Duplicator
- - Color & Material
- - Physics Locking (eg. Keep Upright)
- - Stacker
- - Network Ownership changer
- - Smartsnap grid overlay for all tools
- - UI tool panels, including ModelSelector with extendable `.spawnlist`'s
- Undo System
- DynShapes spawnmenu: like PHX, but dynamic, fully customizable sizes using procedural meshes. Rectangles, cylinders, spheres, gears!
- Map changer menu
- Physgun & Toolgun model
- [Wirebox](https://github.com/wiremod/wirebox) support
- [Many new events](EVENTS.md) (aiming to reproduce many of Gmod 1's)
